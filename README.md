# Learn2Read
An early childhood education mobile application.

2020 has been an extraordinary transformative year, for better or worse. One of the changes caused by COVID-19 was the shift from traditional in-class learning 
to remote learning for the entire education system in the United States. Teachers are now faced with the monumental task of implementing remote learning within
existing ciriculum while keeping their students engaged in class material. This becomes especially challenging with younger students shifting to remote learning,
such as being taught how to read.

Our goal is to provide teachers a resource for teaching students how to read and to become more familar with using mobile applications.

# Repository Information

This repository contains both the backend and frontend code for the Learn2Read mobile app. The app was created using React Native, which allows the application
to run on Android and iOS applications natively from a single JavsScript codebase. 

To run the app, open the codebase in your preferred text editor and run the following code in the terminal:
```
npm install
npm install expo-cli --global
npm start
```

Running these commands will install and open up expo, which is a set of tools used for React Native development. When expo opens up in the web browser, if you have
an Android or iOS emulator running, click on their respective run buttons. Otherwise, feel free to download expo on your physical device and scan the QR code on the 
lower right-hand corner. If there is an issue with the LAN connection, switch over to the Tunnel connection. If there are further connection issues, or code 500 errors
rendering on your screen, you may have to run the terminal commands again.
